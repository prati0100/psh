# What is psh?
psh is a very simple (and likely buggy) shell I am writing as a learning exercise.

# Who is psh shell for?
No sane person will ever want to use it.

If you are insane enough to consider writing a shell or looking at how one might be written, then this is for you. Have fun!

# How to build it?
For a debug build, run:
```
make
```

For a "release" build, run:
```
make release
```

But let's be honest, you aren't releasing this garbage code to anyone anyway. But I enjoy feeling like a real developer so I added this rule.
make release disable the debug macros so you don't run assertions and stuff.

To clean up the object files for a fresh start, run:
```
make clean
```

# How to contribute code?
Really? Do you really want to contribute? Wow! Open a pull request, and I'll take a look.
